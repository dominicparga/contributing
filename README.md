# how to develop

This repo collects all kinds of contributing information, so my other projects can link to it.
Further, it helps me remembering all kind of development-related stuff, collects useful links and so on.

## TODO

* add horizontal lines to markdown.md
* add markdown syntax explicitly in file (currently it's just shown implicitly by using it in the file)
