These points should be considered and checked for a new release.

* Has `release` been merged into `master`?
* Is a new teaser picture needed/recommended?

## [Semantic Versioning][www_semantic_versioning]

"Given a version number `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, increment the:

* `MAJOR` version when incompatible API changes are made,
* `MINOR` version when functionality in a backwards-compatible manner is added, and
* `PATCH` version when backwards-compatible bug fixes are made.

Exception could be alpha or beta status, when the software hasn't reached 1.0.0 yet.
Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`."
