\section*{References}

    Please number citations consecutively within brackets \cite{eason1955certain}.
    The sentence punctuation follows the bracket \cite{maxwell1892treatise}.
    Refer simply to the reference number, as in \cite{jacobs1963anisotropy}---do not use ``Ref. \cite{jacobs1963anisotropy}'' or ``reference \cite{jacobs1963anisotropy}'' except at the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference \cite{jacobs1963anisotropy} was the first $\ldots$''

    Number footnotes separately in superscripts.
    Place the actual footnote at the bottom of the column in which it was cited.
    Do not put footnotes in the abstract or reference list.
    Use letters for table footnotes.

    Unless there are six authors or more give all authors' names; do not use ``et al.''.
    Papers that have not been published, even if they have been submitted for publication, should be cited as ``unpublished'' \cite{elissa}.
    Papers that have been accepted for publication should be cited as ``in press'' \cite{nicole}.
    Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and element symbols.

    For papers published in translation journals, please give the English citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation \cite{yorozu1987electron}.
