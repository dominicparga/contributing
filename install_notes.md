| tools                             | `macOS`                 |
|:----------------------------------|:-----------------------:|
| [`Alfred`](#alfred)               | :ballot_box_with_check: |
| [`Bash`](#bash)                   | :ballot_box_with_check: |
| [`Homebrew`](#brew)               | :ballot_box_with_check: |

## Alfred <a name="alfred"></a>

A very intelligent and handy search-bar for `macOS`

```zsh
brew cask install alfred
```

## Bash <a name="bash"></a>

```zsh
brew install bash
brew install bash-completion@2
```

## Homebrew <a name="brew"></a>

Package-manager for `macOS`.
The other installation-guides (if `macOS`) bases on `brew`.
I prefer it over `macports` since, a few years ago, installing compiler for c++ was difficult.
Further, it supports a lot of software.

```zsh
if ( command -v brew 1>/dev/null 2>/dev/null ); then
    echo "Updating homebrew and formulae..."
    brew update
    brew upgrade
    brew cask upgrade
    brew cleanup
else
    echo "Installing homebrew..."
    /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
fi
```

## Java and Scala <a name="java-scala"></a>

```zsh
# important execution order!
brew cask install java
brew install scala
brew install sbt
```

## LaTeX <a name="latex"></a>

```zsh
brew cask install mactex
```
