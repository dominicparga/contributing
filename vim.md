# Vim

Vim is a way of navigating and editing text-files.
What makes vim special is its separation of __viewing__ text and __editing__ text.
For this, vim supports different modes with different key-usage.

- The __normal__-mode allows navigating through the text and executing handy commands, like "marking everything between brackets".
- The __insert__-mode allows adding new text.
- The __visual__ allows marking text, e.g. for deleting it.

There is a great tutorial for vim, which is probably already installed on your machine.
You can execute `vimtutor` in terminal and go.
Although the tutorial could be done in half an hour, it takes much longer to fully understand all commands and many commands are just not that important for most of the time.
This page provides a summary of the most important commands, which will cover more or less your whole daily vim-usage.

You can easily select vim in several IDEs, like [visual-studio-code][vscode] (and configure the hell out of it, which is not covered here).
With the overview of this page, it should be pretty easy to get into it. `:)`

## Vim-inputs in general <a name="inputs-in-general"></a>

Inputs can be distinguished in 2 categories:

- targetless, like `move cursor one character right`
- targeted, like `delete next word`

When targeted input, the input contains the command (like `d` for __delete__), then a cursor-movement (`e` = __end__ of word) or a target (`iw` = __word__ where cursor is currently __in__).


Further, most commands can be repeated automatically by adding a number before the command.
While `w` jumps a word (see below), input `3w` will jump 3 words.

## Deleting text with target <a name="deleting-text-with-target"></a>

Usually, deletions are initiated with `d`, followed by a cursor-movement-command (see above) or a target (see above).
You can delete text with `c` entering insert-mode afterwards.
In the following, some examples are given, working for both `d` and `c`.
