# Licensing

> Licensing can be a mess and confusing.
> This info-sheet should help understanding the licenses, but __does not__ guarantee correctness in a legal sense.
> Please read the licenses by yourself and, if needed, ask a lawyer for advice.

Don't forget to edit copied licenses-text, e.g. adding the year and your name.


## Apache 2.0

The `Apache-2.0`-license can be found [here][apache.org/license].
An example for a `NOTICE`-file can be found [here][apache.org/notice].


## MIT

The `MIT`-license can be found [here][opensource.org/mit].


## Apache 2.0 vs. MIT

> As already mentioned, please read the licenses by yourself and view the following descriptions as guideline, not as a legally solid document.

While the `MIT`-license and `Apache-2.0`-license are quite similar in their basic concept, the `Apache-2.0`-license provides much more details and describes the issues from a more lawyer-centered perspective.Though they are comparable from a legal perspective they are not totally identical, which, obviously, affects the use of code licensed under them. To be more precise, the `Apache-2.0` has some extras and small restrictions compared to the `MIT`-license.

Basically, with both licenses, you are allowed to distribute, change and commercially use the code as you wish, as long as you are mentioning its original creator.
The main difference lays in `ยง4-Redistribution` and `ยง6-Trademarks` of the `Apache-2.0`-license.
While the `MIT`-license tries to simplify these topics, leading to more freedom, the `Apache-2.0` specifies some conditions.

- `Redistribution`: The `Apache-2.0`-license demands mentioning changes somewhere.
  The `NOTICE`-file can be added for the `Apache-2.0` for additional comments.
  As far as I understand the license, you may use it for these changes as well.
- `Trademarks`: The `Apache-2.0`-license does not permit the usage of trademarks.

Long story short, `Apache-2.0` grants more protection to the creator and his/her work by mentioning changes and protecting trademarks, while `MIT` focusses on the redistribution of the work.


## WTFPL

The `WTFPL`-license can be found [here][wtfpl].
It is what it's called: "You just DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO".


## GPL

Good and official source is [gnu.org][gnu.org/licenses/gplv3], e.g. when it comes to using GPL-software in own projects.
There, you can find a nice pictured overview about compatible licenses and some explanations.
